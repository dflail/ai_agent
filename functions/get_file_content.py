# This function reads the content of a file located at `file_path` within the specified `working_directory`.
# It ensures that the file is within the working directory and does not exceed a maximum character limit
# defined by `MAX_CHARS`. If the file is too large, it truncates the content and appends a message
# indicating that the file has been truncated. The function handles errors gracefully, returning appropriate
# error messages for various failure scenarios.
